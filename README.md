## Overview

This project provides an interactive 3D simulation of a hydropower plant, allowing users to control water flow and observe real-time power generation. The simulation includes a detailed dam structure, water reservoir, turbines, and power distribution infrastructure, all presented in an engaging and educational interface.

## Features

- **Interactive Controls**: Adjust water flow gates and observe immediate effects on power generation
- **Multiple Camera Views**: Switch between various perspectives to examine different parts of the hydropower plant
- **Real-time Physics**: Watch water flow, turbine rotation, and energy generation with realistic animations
- **Power Output Metrics**: Monitor power generation and efficiency statistics in real-time
- **Detailed Environment**: Explore a complete ecosystem including mountains, vegetation, and water bodies

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: Core 3D rendering engine for creating and manipulating the simulation environment
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: Smooth animations and transitions for camera movement
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Responsive user interface with interactive controls
- **JavaScript**: Core programming and simulation physics logic

## How It Works

The simulation demonstrates the key components of hydroelectric power generation:

1. Water stored in a reservoir behind the dam
2. Controlled water flow through adjustable gates
3. Flowing water turning turbine blades
4. Turbine rotation powering a generator
5. Electricity production displayed with illuminating bulbs and power output metrics
6. Power distribution through transmission lines
